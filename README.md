## Desktop First
With Desktop First we can build all the features we want and create them properly by the screen areas. And when we want to make it responsible, we only focus on a lightweight interface without worrying about the quality of the features. In this way we can achieve that the page is seen as we want regardless of the limitations of the areas.

With desktop first we avoid using javascript to fix the mobile UI at the beginning. Another advantage would be [the majority of the audience uses fakeflix in large screens.](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/7/17094610/netflix-70-percent-tv-viewing-statistics)

--------------------------

Create the UI of Fakeflix, it should:

- [ ] Be Responsive.
- [ ] Include CSS animations and transitions.
- [ ] Explain why your team decided to go Desktop First or Mobile First.
- [ ] Include the Who is Watching screen
- [ ] Include the List of Content screen
- [ ] Include the Content Detail screen

![Who is Watching](https://github.com/ableco/code-school/blob/master/_media/m3w3/who-is-watching.png)
![List of content](https://github.com/ableco/code-school/blob/master/_media/m3w3/content-list.png)
![Content Detail](https://github.com/ableco/code-school/blob/master/_media/m3w3/content-detail.jpg)

- It's not required to be pixel perfect.
- Animations which could not be replicated with only CSS are not required or should be implemented partially.
